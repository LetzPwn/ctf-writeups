## LetzPwn trains A/D for the ECSC

<p>On July 9th 2022, the LetzPwn team participated in the FaustCTF 2022 competition.</p>

<p>This event is, similarly to SaarCTF, an Attack-Defense CTF competition and is organised by the Friedrich-Alexander Universität (Erlangen-Nürnberg) Security Team, or FAUST for short</p>
<p>The FaustCTF has been organised for the seventh time in 2022 and is a renowned competition, popular among many good teams. The difficulty is accordingly advanced. FaustCTF 2022 was comprised of 8 challenges, named <code>Ghost</code>, <code>Digital Seconds Ago</code>, <code>AdminCrashBoard</code>, <code>Docs Notebook</code>, <code>Notes from the Future</code>, <code>Flux Mail</code>, <code>FittyFit</code> and <code>compiler60</code>.</p>
<p>We only participated with around 4 people and managed to exploit one service (<code>AdminCrashBoard</code>). The vulnerability for this one consisted of Command Injection. We also looked at the <code>FittyFit</code> service, which we were not able to solve. Afterwards, we checked the intended solution, which consisted either (1) of a login bypass because of a cryptographic failure in the cookie creation or (2) using a pretty advanced attack chain (for a one-day A/D CTF) consisting of finding that the version of a dependency was vulnerable to XXE, crafting a malicious pdf with it and then using some service logic to being able to access the uploaded malicious pdf to trigger the XXE.</p>
<p>Overall, we placed 64th out of 91 participating teams.</p>
