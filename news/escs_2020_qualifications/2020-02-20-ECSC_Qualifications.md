## Lëtz Cybersecurity Challenge 2020

### Official Challenge description
The Cybersecurity Challenge Luxembourg is organized by C3, the Cybersecurity Competence Center Luxembourg, within the frame of the GAME OF CODE
This competition targets open-minded creative digital natives. Our aim is not only to find talents but encourage young people to pursue a career in cybersecurity and related disciplines.

With over 20 unique challenges on the day, we have tasks and activities to keep participants entertained. Participants have to solve security related tasks from domains such as web security, network security, wireless and IoT security, cryptography, exploitation, reverse engineering, forensics, puzzles, trivia and much more. So if you enjoy solving challenges, coding, security, IT or just having fun then Lëtz Cybersecurity Challenge is for you.  


### Secondary Goals
If you're between the age of 15-25, participating in this challenge is the first step of being able to join the official team representing Luxembourg at the European Cybersecurity Challenge 2020 in Vienna, Austria! This is the event that brought together the core team of LetzPwn and you'd be a fool not to try and join it since it was one of the best experiences that any person vaguely interested in Cybersecurity can enjoy!

### LetzPwn
