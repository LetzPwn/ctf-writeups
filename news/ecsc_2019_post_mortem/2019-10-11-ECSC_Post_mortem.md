LetzPwn was the first team ever representing Luxembourg in the European Cybersecurity Challenge (ECSC). That's actually a lie. LetzPwn didn't exist yet when we participated at the ECSC. Back then we were called "Lëtz Cybersecurity Team". It's after the ECSC event that we concluded we don't want to lose contact with each other. This resulted the creation of the "LetzPwn" community: Not only a team, but a community for people with the same interests.
